            Bitcoin operates on a public ledger called the blockchain, where
            mining plays a crucial role in confirming and securing transactions.
            Miners validate transactions, preventing double-spending while
            earning rewards. Initially, miners received 12.5 BTC per block, but
            this decreases over time. Due to the computational intensity of
            mining, the term &ldquo;mining&rdquo; draws an analogy to physical gold mining.

          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            Hash rate determines how fast your hardware can process
            calculations. A higher hash rate increases mining speed and
            profitability. Measured in MH/sec (megahashes per second), high-end
            hardware reaches TH/sec (terahashes per second). Faster processing
            improves your chances of earning rewards

            Mining hardware consumes significant electricity, impacting profits.
            Calculate energy costs by dividing your device&rsquo;s hash rate by its
            power consumption in watts. Profitable mining balances high
            efficiency with minimal power usage

            CPUs were once viable for mining but are now obsolete. GPUs offered
            a breakthrough, mining 50&ndash;100x faster than CPUs. However, due to
            increasing difficulty, GPUs are no longer profitable for Bitcoin
            mining.

            FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) improved efficiency,
            consuming 80% less power than GPUs. The ultimate advancement came
            with ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits), designed
            solely for Bitcoin mining. ASICs operate at 100x the speed of GPUs
            while using less electricity, making them the dominant mining
            solution today.

          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            Due to intense competition, solo mining is less viable. Mining pools
            allow miners to combine resources, increasing the chances of earning
            rewards. These rewards are distributed proportionally based on
            contributions. However, most pools charge fees between 1&ndash;10%.

            Can You Profitably Mine Bitcoin?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            Mining profitability has declined due to increased competition and
            mining difficulty. Today, large-scale operations with cheap
            electricity dominate the industry. Individual miners often find that
            electricity costs exceed mining revenue. However, advancements in
            ASICs and mining software may eventually make small-scale mining
            feasible again.

          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            Cloud mining offers an alternative by renting computing power from
            large-scale mining companies. It eliminates hardware and electricity
            costs, requiring only an internet connection and a Bitcoin wallet.
            However, cloud mining carries risks, so it&rsquo;s essential to choose
            reputable providers like Apexion.
