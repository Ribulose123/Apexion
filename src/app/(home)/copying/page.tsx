          <h2 className="text-2xl font-light mb-6">Who Are The Experts?</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            We carefully select expert applicants. We get to know them as a
            trader and examine their trading performance over a period of time.
            We also tend to look for expert who already have a following to
            further confirm their competence (social proof). You can also read
            about every expert on their individual performance pages.

        <section className="mb-12">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-light mb-6">How does this work?</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">Here is how the copier works: You, as an investor, simply select an expert or experts that you want to copy trades from. Once you are signed up, this is the only action needed on your part.</p>
          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">Once you’ve taken care of the above, you are all set. There are no codes that you need to run or signals for you to manually input. Our software will handle the trade copying automatically on your behalf. We monitor your experts trading activity and as soon as there is a trade, we calculate all the necessary parameters and execute the trade.</p>
          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">The copier works based on trade percent amount. So, for example, if your expert takes a position in XYZ coin for a total of 10% of his account value and you are 100% allocated to that expert, then the copier will also execute a trade in your account in the amount of 10% of your account value.</p>
          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">The only thing you have to make sure of is that you have enough available base currency that your expert trades with, in your trading account. How much is enough? First, you must meet the exchanges minimum order amount (let’s say about $10 per trade to be safe). That means that if your expert executes a 5% order, you must have at least $300 in your account total value (at 100% expert allocation as an example). This also means that you need to have at least 10% or higher in available base currency to avoid missed trades.</p>
          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">When the expert exits a position, you too will exit it. Automatically. You can also change allocation at any time.</p>
